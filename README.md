# Events-Hub - An all in one events booking solution
A complete package of admin and user sides of a ticket booking website with multiple functionality using MEAN Stack.

## Abstract

There are various levels of admins; the ones incharge of the entire portal who can add or delete events and make any changes to the events & the event admins who can add and view all details relevant to the details of the events they are in charge of.
